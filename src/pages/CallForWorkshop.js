                    The academics, professionals, researchers, and industrial
                    community is invited to submit proposals for the
                    organization of Workshops/Special Sessions at ICITA 2022 -
                    16th International Conference on Information Technology and

                    ICITA is a prestigious global forum for researchers and
                    practitioners to present and discuss the most recent
                    innovations, trends, results, experiences, and concerns in
                    the several perspectives of Information Systems and
                    Technologies.

                  <h4>Workshop/Special Session Format</h4>
                  <p align="left">
                    Workshops/Special Sessions should focus on a specific
                    scientific subject on the scope of ICITA'22 but not directly
                    included on the main conference areas. Each workshop/Special
                    Session will be coordinated by an organizing committee
                    composed of, at least, two researchers in the field,
                    preferably from different institutions and different
                    countries. The organizers should create an international
                    program committee for the Workshop/Special Session, with
                    recognized researchers within the specific Workshop/Special
                    Session scientific area. The selection of Workshops/Special
                    Sessions will be performed by ICITA'22 Workshop/Special
                    Session Chairs. Workshops/Special Session papers will be
                    published in the conference main proceedings.
